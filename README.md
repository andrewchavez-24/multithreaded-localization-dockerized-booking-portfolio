# Multithreaded Localization & Dockerized Booking System (Demo Overview)

> ðŸ“Œ *This repository is public for demonstration purposes only. All code remains private in compliance with WGUâ€™s academic integrity policy.*

This project simulates a robust booking system built with advanced Java techniques. It features multithreaded processing for handling simultaneous booking requests and full support for internationalization (i18n). The application is containerized with Docker to enable consistent deployment across environments.

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack
- Java (Multithreading, OOP)
- Java ResourceBundle API (Localization)
- Docker

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features
- Thread-safe operations using synchronized methods and thread pools
- Localization support via external resource bundles (multiple languages)
- Dockerized application for cross-platform deployment
- Booking simulation with concurrent request handling
- Modular and maintainable code structure

## ðŸ“¦ Tools & Concepts
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Docker CLI / Docker Desktop
- Java Concurrency APIs (e.g., `Thread`, `ExecutorService`)
- Internationalization (i18n) with `Locale` and `ResourceBundle`
- Clean code design with separation of concerns
